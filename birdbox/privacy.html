            <h2>Data collected by BirdBox</h2>
            <p>BirdBox may be collecting the following information on users, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Content of deleted messages users sent in servers (only if the user who sent it has snipes enabled.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lyric/image responses (only if manually added by the admins of BirdBox)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Maybe Pile (new features list) entries (manually added by BirdBox admins)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Configuration Settings (per user and server, necessary for BirdBox to save settings)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Last sent message, for every channel BirdBox has access to. (for jinx detection.)
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The BirdBox website may also be collecting the following information on visitors.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    HTTP server logs containing your IP address, user agent and pages visited on the website
                    <br>automatically stored by NGINX (the web server that the BirdBox website uses.)
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Messages are stored plaintext in the BirdBox database (only on the server BirdBox is running on),
                however these messages are also unencrypted on Discord's end and can also be collected by the Discord Client.
            </p>
            <p>Data collected for snipes is the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Message content
                </li>
                <li>
                    The username of the person who sent the deleted message
                </li>
                <li>
                    Time and date of when the deleted message was sent
                </li>
                <li>The URL of attachments/images sent in the message (attachment/image content is not stored by BirdBox, only the Discord CDN,
                    BirdBox simply sends a link to the file on the Discord CDN.)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>No data is sent to the BirdBox developers or anyone else, and the data is only stored in the BirdBox database file which is stored only on the server running BirdBox</p>
            <p>The only ways to access the data is by directly viewing the database file, or via commands that use the database.</p>
            <h2>Information about other instances.</h2>
            <p>Since BirdBox is free and open source software, other people can host their own instances of BirdBox and modify the code, 
                so we can not guarantee that their instance is or isn't collecting more data.</p>
            <p>To see if the instance you use abides by this privacy policy, check if the bot user is the following ("BirdBox#8577", "BirdBox Canary#9065")
                as these instances are run by TheBirdWasHere.
            </p>
            <p>Other ways to check are by checking the source code of the bot (we recommend doing this if you are able), this way
                you will know for sure exactly what BirdBox is doing with the data. You can find the code for the Offical BirdBox instances
                at <a href="https://github.com/grumpzalt/BirdBox">our GitHub Repo here.</a>
            </p>
            <p>If your instance is not run by TheBirdWasHere, please ask the owner of your instance if they have modified the code, for details on what data is collected,
                or for a copy of the source code, as the license that BirdBox uses requires them to provide the source code upon request.
